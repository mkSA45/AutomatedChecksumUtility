# Task Automation for Ebook Management
The set of scripts here are to automate certain tasks when managing ebooks from a certain website. 
If you are just looking to automate certain actions and do not write code for personal/work/research/etc purposes, then proceed to the 'How To Use' section at the end of this Readme. 
If you do write code for any reason, then perhaps attempting the challenge 1st before using the 'How To Use' section could be beneficial for you in terms of appreciating the need to document how to use the scripts/code you create(and also how to use the software tools that you have configured, but this 2nd point on software tools is not done in this challenge/activity).

Note: the zip files in 'a_usageNotes' & 'b_hint' are not password protected. Its just to facilitate the 'Challenge' section, so that when searching text with Visual Studio Code(tested with version 1.63.2, no extensions installed. Or any text editor that can search across the folder), it will not reveal the website to be used on unless you unzip the zip files. 

## Challenge
### Intended audience
Any person who writes code/scripts(e.g. powershell, linux bash scripts) or develop/maintain software. This includes software developers(mainly), engineers(e.g. electrical, chemical, mechanical), physicists, game developers. People who develop/maintain software in aerospace, medical, etc. All of the described groups of persons in this Intended Audience section will be called 'coders' in subsequent sections.

### Rational of Challenge
Many coders create code but do not realise their code can have missing context for how to use it. Sometimes it is not too serious, such as methods in utility class of a web application that is well organised and properly named, such that its purpose and usage is clear. It sometimes can be more severe, such as poorly organised code/methods in a Java/C# application such that forming a coherent and sequential understanding of what it is doing is difficult, and other coders find it difficult to improve the code. Sometimes the reason is that the code/script has been used often by the creator, thus he knows how to use it and how/when/why to modify it, which is not always immediately clear to others who look at the code.

This challenge will demonstrate 2 ways in which code can be rendered meaningless and the importance of creating documentation(and just as equally important,  commenting code, but this is not done in this challenge):
Lack of Business Context
Lack of Explanation on How to Use

'Lack of Business Context': This will be most evident early on in this challenge, since if we do not understand what the code is intended for, even if the code hints its use in automating certain actions, we are unable to benefit from it. (The challenge is intentionally made this way by removing mentions of the web site it is intended to be used on. But Hint 1 in 'How to do this Challenge' was provided so that you can progress.)

'Lack of Explanation on How to Use': This will be noticeable when the appropriate use(how, when & why to use) of the code/scripts is not documented. The person could try to understand how to use the script by reading it, but it can be quite time-consuming(This will occur after using Hint 1 and without using documents in 'a_usageNotes' folder). This scenario occurs when scripts/software tools/code have been created/configured and are complex enough that its proper use cannot be immediately understood just by looking through the script or the configuration UI of the software tool(e.g. Jenkins jobs with parameters).

### How to do this Challenge
The challenge is considered complete when you know how and when(and also why) to use scripts 2 to 4. 
Hint 0: The intended sequence of usage is 2, 3, 4.

Script 2 to 4 is intended to be used when you own a bundle, and since I mentioned in 'Rational of Challenge' under 'Lack of Business Context' that the web site these scripts are to be used on is not mentioned in any of the scripts, it is expected that Hint 1 is definitely needed.

If after reading script 2 and you do not know how to use it, please unzip and view 'Hint1.zip' in the hint folder.

## How To Use
The exact and specific steps on how to use the scripts numbered 0 to 4 here can be found in the zip of the text file placed in 'a_usageNotes' folder.
