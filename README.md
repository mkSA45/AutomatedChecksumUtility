# Task Automation for Ebook Management
The set of scripts here are to automate certain tasks when managing ebooks from a certain website. 
If you are just looking to automate certain actions and do not write code for personal/work/research/etc purposes, then proceed to the 'How To Use' section at the end of this Readme. 
If you do write code for any reason, then perhaps attempting the challenge 1st before using the 'How To Use' section could be beneficial for you in terms of appreciating the need to document how to use the scripts/code you create(and also how to use the software tools that you have configured, but this 2nd point on software tools is not done in this challenge/activity).

Note: the zip files in 'a_usageNotes' & 'b_hint' are not password protected. Its just to facilitate the 'Challenge' section, so that when searching text with Visual Studio Code, it will not reveal the website to be used on unless you unzip the zip files. 

## Challenge
The 3 subsections 'Intended audience', 'Rational of Challenge' and 'How to do this Challenge' have been shifted into 'c_activity/Challenge_Section.docx'
### Suggestion for this workshop/activity
If you have a friend who does programming/coding, the 2 of you could do the 'How to do this Challenge' subsection(with the below restrictions) to see how quickly they can get up to speed for the code/scripts in this repo. The arrangement/restrictions should be:
1. person A is allowed to go straight to this readme's 'How To Use' section and use the text file with detailed instructions
2. person B is not allowed to use 'How To Use' section, but must use the 'How to do this Challenge' in 'c_activity/Challenge_Section.docx'. If all hints have been used, they can only rely on reading the code/scripts to understand how to use it. 
3. person A cannot communicate to person B with the instructions within the text file mentioned in 'How To Use' section. person B should also not be allowed to see how person A is operating the scripts. 

The activity is considered complete when both person A and B know how to confidently use the scripts with minimal mistakes. Person B is allowed to end the activity and use the 'How To Use' section if they are taking too long to be confident in the use of the scripts(person A should have less problems since the steps are all explained).

## How To Use
The exact and specific steps on how to use the scripts numbered 0 to 4 here can be found in the zip of the text file placed in 'a_usageNotes' folder.
